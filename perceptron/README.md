In this project, I implement 3 versions of the perceptron algorithm: the perceptron, the
average perceptron, and the kernel perceptron for two seperate binary classification tasks (Spam vs. Non-spam and Atheism vs. Religion).Please view the *perceptron.pdf* file for project details and the *Report.pdf* for implementation results.
