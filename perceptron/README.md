In this project, I implement 3 versions of the perceptron algorithm: the perceptron, the
average perceptron, and the kernel perceptron for *Spam vs. Non-spam* and *Atheism vs. Religion* text classification tasks. Please view the *perceptron.pdf* file for project details and the *Report.pdf* for implementation results.
