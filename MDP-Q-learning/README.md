In this project, I implement the two classic methods for solving Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs) with finite state and action spaces: Value Iteration (VI) and Policy Iteration (PI), to find the optimal policy in a finite number of iterations. I also implement Q-learning to control a Crawler robot. Please view the **Implementation** section in the *MDP-Q-learning.pdf* file for project details.
